                <p>CALGARY, Alberta (TNS) — Erik Karlsson has been one of the Penguins' best players this season and easily their most important defenseman. So when he went on injured reserve Jan. 13, it seemed the Pittsburgh blue line would be in trouble — particularly offensively. The team's ragtag group of D-men said not so fast. Parker Wotherspoon, Brett Kulak and Connor Clifton have five goals this season. Three have come in the past two games. None of those players were on the team last season. "It's great for these guys to be chipping in," Penguins coach Dan Muse said after Monday's win in Seattle. "We want everybody involved in the offense, and obviously they have been the last couple of games." The team's less heralded defensemen will likely have to carry an even bigger load Wednesday at the Flames, as Kris Letang is out day-to-day with an upper-body injury. That would have been a particularly bad blow, if not for the team's more positive injury news Tuesday. Karlsson practiced in a regular jersey for the first time since his injury and appears set to return sooner than the initial timeline indicated.
