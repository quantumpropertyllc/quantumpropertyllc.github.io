Fourth quarter revenue exceeded $2 billion, and full year revenue was a record, up 16% year-over-year(b). Full year results met or exceeded each of the financial targets we communicated at the beginning of the year. During the year, we generated approximately 1,200 basis points of adjusted operating leverage(b) and 280 basis points of adjusted fee-based operating leverage(b). Tangible book value per share grew 3% sequentially and 18% year-over-year.In addition to driving greater return on capital, we remain committed to the return of capital. To this end, we resumed share repurchases at an accelerated pace, buying back $200 million of common shares in the fourth quarter while maintaining peer-leading capital ratios. Given our excess capital position and meaningful capital generation capabilities, we are well positioned to further increase our return of capital to our shareholders in 2026. Looking forward, I am confident that we will deliver another year of strong organic revenue and earnings growth. Our strategic investments - particularly in front-line bankers and technology - continue to fuel organic growth and enhance our ability to deliver best-in-class capabilities and service to our clients. Business momentum remains strong. Assets under management reached a record $70 billion. Investment banking and debt placement fees recorded the second-best annual performance in our history, and pipelines remain elevated.I am incredibly proud of our results, our continued momentum, and most importantly, the talented teammates behind our success. This morning, we announced changes to the composition of our Board which reflect strong leadership that will drive the next phase of value creation for Key. I remain confident that our focus, resilience, and dedication will continue to deliver value to the stakeholders we serve – our shareholders, our clients, and our communities."(a) See table on page 25 for more information on Selected Items Impact on Earnings.(b) The table entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" in the attached financial supplement presents the computations of certain financial measures related to "adjusted revenue", "pre-provision net revenue", "adjusted pre-provision net revenue", "adjusted noninterest income", "adjusted noninterest expense", "adjusted total operating leverage", "adjusted fee-based operating leverage", "adjusted net income", and "adjusted earnings per share".

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, net interest income increased by $162 million, and the net interest margin increased by 41 basis points. These increases primarily reflect lower deposit costs, the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing low-yielding investment securities, swaps and fixed-rate loans into higher-yielding investments, and the repositioning of the available-for-sale portfolio during the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, the balance sheet composition shifted to reflect a more favorable mix of higher-yielding commercial and industrial loans and an improved funding mix as lower-cost deposits increased while wholesale borrowings declined. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on variable-rate earning assets.Compared to the third quarter of 2025, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $30 million, and the net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. These increases were driven by lower deposit costs, an improved funding mix as lower-cost deposit balances increased while wholesale borrowings declined, and a shift in the balance sheet composition to a more favorable mix of higher-yielding commercial and industrial loans. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on variable-rate earning assets.Noninterest IncomeDollars in millionsChange 4Q25 vs.4Q253Q254Q243Q254Q24Trust and investment services income$ 156$ 150$ 1424.0 %9.9 %Investment banking and debt placement fees24318422132.110.0Cards and payments income848685(2.3)(1.2)Service charges on deposit accounts7875654.020.0Corporate services income81726912.517.4Commercial mortgage servicing fees687368(6.8)—Corporate-owned life insurance income40353614.311.1Consumer mortgage income16141614.3—Operating lease income and other leasing gains91115(18.2)(40.0)Other income78(5)(12.5)N/MNet securities gains (losses)—(6)(908)N/MN/MTotal noninterest income$ 782$ 702$ (196)11.4 %N/MN/M = Not MeaningfulCompared to the fourth quarter of 2024, noninterest income increased by $978 million. The increase was primarily driven by the impact of a $915 million loss on the sale of securities as part of the strategic repositioning of the portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2024. Adjusted noninterest income(a) grew 8% primarily driven by a $22 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees, a $12 million increase in corporate services income, and continued momentum in trust and investment services and commercial payments.Compared to the third quarter of 2025, noninterest income increased by $80 million. The increase was driven by a $59 million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees reflective of higher merger and acquisition advisory fees as well as commercial debt placement fees, a $9 million increase in corporate services income, and a $6 million increase in trust and investment services income.Noninterest ExpenseDollars in millionsChange 4Q25 vs.4Q253Q254Q243Q254Q24Personnel expense$ 790$ 742$ 7346.5 %7.6 %Net occupancy6965676.23.0Computer processing1061051071.0(.9)Business services and professional fees61445538.610.9Equipment22202010.010.0Operating lease expense8915(11.1)(46.7)Marketing28223327.3(15.2)Other expense157170198(7.6)(20.7)Total noninterest expense$ 1,241$ 1,177$ 1,2295.4 %1.0 %Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, noninterest expense increased by $12 million. The increase was predominantly driven by a $56 million increase in personnel expense primarily related to incentive compensation associated with noninterest income growth, continued investments in people, and employee benefits. These were partially offset by a decrease in other expense related to a $21 million benefit associated with the updated FDIC special assessment.Compared to the third quarter of 2025, noninterest expense increased by $64 million. The increase was predominantly driven by a $48 million increase in personnel expense, primarily related to incentive compensation associated with noninterest income growth, seasonally higher employee benefits, and continued investments in people. Business services and professional fees increased by $17 million due to technology-related investments and seasonality. These were partially offset by a decrease in other expense related to a $21 million benefit associated with the updated FDIC special assessment.(a) The table entitled "GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations" in the attached financial supplement presents the computations related to "adjusted noninterest income". The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.

A relatively stable reserve build of $4 million during the fourth quarter of 2025 was the result of the net impact of improving credit quality trends and resilient economic forecasts offset by growth in unfunded commitments.At December 31, 2025, Key's nonperforming loans totaled $615 million, which represented 0.58% of period-end portfolio loans. These results compare to 0.73% at December 31, 2024, and 0.62% at September 30, 2025.

Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this document, the financial supplement, or conference call slides related to this document, all of which can be found on Key's website (www.key.com/ir). Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures From time to time Key may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Key is unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Key is unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant for future results.Annualized DataCertain returns, yields, performance ratios, or quarterly growth rates are presented on an "annualized" basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying performance trends when compared to full-year or year-over-year amounts.Taxable EquivalentThe interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. Income from tax-exempt earning assets is increased by an amount equivalent to the taxes that would have been paid if this income had been taxable at the federal statutory rate. This adjustment puts all earning assets, most notably tax-exempt loans, and certain lease assets, on a common basis that facilitates comparison of results to peers.Earnings Per Share Equivalent Certain income or expense items may be expressed on a per common share basis. This is done for analytical and decision-making purposes to better discern underlying trends in total consolidated earnings per share performance excluding the impact of such items. When the impact of certain income or expense items is disclosed separately, the after-tax amount is computed using the marginal tax rate, unless otherwise specified, with this then being the amount used to calculate the earnings per share equivalent.Financial Highlights(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)Three months ended12/31/20259/30/202512/31/2024Summary of operationsNet interest income (TE)$ 1,223$ 1,193$ 1,061Noninterest income782702(196) Total revenue (TE)2,0051,895865Provision for credit losses10810739Noninterest expense1,2411,1771,229Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key509490(244)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes1(1)—Net income (loss) attributable to Key510489(244)Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders474454(279)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes1(1)—Net income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders475453(279)Per common shareIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders$ .43$ .41$ (.28)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes———Net income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders (a).43.41(.28)Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders — assuming dilution.43.41(.28)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes — assuming dilution———Net income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders — assuming dilution (a).43.41(.28)Full story available on Benzinga.com</p>
