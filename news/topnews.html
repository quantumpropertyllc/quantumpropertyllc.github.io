                <p>Right-wing conspiracy theorist and activist Laura Loomer unleashed a bombshell claim Friday night that members of the Republican Party are intentionally tanking the midterms to pave the way for President Donald Trump's impeachment.Loomer laid out her theory with stark language on X. "You can tell a lot of people in the GOP are deliberately trying to botch the midterms so that President Trump is impeached," she wrote, adding the ominous question: "What happens if President Trump gets impeached? We all know."The firebrand activist suggested the scenario is all part of a coordinated scheme. "Guess it's all part of 'their plan,'" Loomer stated, before doubling down on the seriousness of her claims."Once you see it, there is no unseeing it," she declared, before delivering her final verdict: "It's evil."Loomer has become notorious for her provocative social media presence and controversial statements. She has faced backlash even from ardent Trump supporters such as former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and has even been banned from multiple social media platforms.</p>

I have to say, they are some of the toughest people I’ve ever seen. Tough, not just because they’re battling frigid, frostbite temperature to go to these protests, but also think about what they’ve been through in the last six weeks.” He added, “This community has been through so much, and, yet, through it all, they continue hitting the streets to protest.
