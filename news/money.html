                <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Jan. 18, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new crypto project developing a lending protocol on Ethereum, has confirmed the completion of its Halborn Security audit as the roadmap moves into Phase 2. The team also provided updates regarding the upcoming V1 launch and the structure of the ongoing token distribution.Protocol OverviewMutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending system that will allow users to supply and borrow crypto assets through smart contracts. The protocol includes two lending environments. The first environment is a pooled market, where multiple users supply assets into shared liquidity and receive mtTokens that track both principal and yield. The second environment is a peer-to-peer market for assets that may not be suited for the pooled structure. These peer loans include collateral requirements, borrowing rates, and liquidation rules.The pooled environment is designed for popular and liquid assets, such as ETH, stablecoins, and major ERC-20 tokens. When users supply assets to these pools, they receive mtTokens that represent their share of the pool. These tokens accumulate interest as borrowers repay debt. mtTokens can be redeemed later for the underlying assets and accrued interest.The peer-to-peer environment offers isolated loan structures. These loans require the borrower to post collateral at a defined Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. If collateral value weakens during market volatility, liquidators can purchase the collateral at a discount to help maintain solvency. This two-track approach places Mutuum Finance ...Full story available on Benzinga.com</p>
