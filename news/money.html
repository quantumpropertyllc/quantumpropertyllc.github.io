                <p>Snapshot: Social media is buzzing with speculation that institutions deliberately sank Bitcoin's price to spook retail and hoover up digital assets at a discount. The idea isn’t baseless, but on closer inspection, the evidence is thin.Did Wall Street crash crypto so it could gobble up your coins? A lot of people seem to think so.

Let's try to separate rumor from reality.Myth 1: MSCI and Morgan Stanley Are Puppet Masters in a Grand CollusionThe Rumor: These two entities, tied by history (MSCI spun out of Morgan Stanley in 2007), orchestrated the dip.
