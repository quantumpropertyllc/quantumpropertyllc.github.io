                <p>Since its inception, crypto has carried a reputation for chaos. Sharp price swings, sudden drawdowns, and emotionally driven trading cycles shaped the perception of the asset class as unpredictable and, for many investors, closer to speculation than finance.Terms like HODL and DYOR emerged as cultural shorthand for surviving volatility rather than managing it. For years, that volatility discouraged broader participation and reinforced the idea that crypto was a market best left to specialists or risk-tolerant traders.Yet over the past year, something has begun to change.Crypto remains volatile and likely always will be, but the way markets respond to volatility is evolving. Increasingly, price shocks do not automatically trigger mass exits from the ecosystem. Instead of rushing to fiat, capital often stays on-chain, rotating into stablecoins, rebalancing exposure, and waiting for more favorable entry points.In that sense, crypto markets are beginning to behave more like a financial market than a casino.When Volatility Became a ToolFor much of crypto's history, market cycles were dominated by retail-driven momentum. Rapid inflows were followed by equally rapid exits, producing fragile liquidity and dramatic drawdowns. Those boom-and-bust dynamics created instability that limited long-term adoption.In 2025, that pattern began to meaningfully shift. Despite multiple volatility events, transaction activity remained resilient, volumes stayed elevated, and capital continued to circulate rather than evaporate. ...Full story available on Benzinga.com</p>
