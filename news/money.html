                <p>BURY ST EDMUNDS, United Kingdom, Jan. 19, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As real-world asset tokenisation gains momentum across DeFi, institutional finance, and blockchain infrastructure, trust and verification have emerged as the sector's biggest bottlenecks. While billions of dollars in RWAs are moving on-chain, most protocols still rely on static audits and off-chain assurances.MetaSoilVerse Protocol is addressing this gap with Proof-of-Asset Integrity (PoAI), a framework designed to enable continuous verification, enforcement, and transparency for tokenised real-world assets.Moving Beyond RWA Tokenisation Towards Verifiable Asset InfrastructureThe next phase of real-world assets requires more than issuance. It requires systems that can continuously prove that on-chain RWAs remain backed, compliant, and operational over time.PoAI is built to ensure that assets supporting tokenised financial products are not only verified at inception but monitored throughout their lifecycle. By embedding integrity checks directly into protocol architecture, MSV reduces reliance on manual processes and trust-based intermediaries.This positions MSV Protocol as core RWA infrastructure, rather than a marketplace or asset issuer.Institutional-Grade Infrastructure for On-Chain Real-World AssetsMSV Protocol is building modular infrastructure designed for asset issuers, funds, and institutions seeking scalable and transparent RWA solutions. The protocol enables:Continuous asset verification for tokenised RWAsOn-chain enforcement of asset performance and complianceReduced counterparty and operational riskImproved investor confidence through verifiable dataBy focusing ...Full story available on Benzinga.com</p>
